    <h3>Tuesday, March 6, 2012</h3>

    <p>
        <q>Water in Art</q> is the theme for the second day, as art students from around the world gather at the Fountain of Intrigue in the gardens of
        <a href="http://www.hotelcontempo.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Contempo</a> to create ice sculptures, and art lecturers discuss the use of water as an art material, and water as an art subject.
    </p>

    <h4>Water in Art Kickoff Session</h4>
    <h5>09:30-10:30am: Elizabeth Hall</h5>

    <p>
        Jennifer Jerome, a native of New Orleans, whose work has centered around abstract images that depict flooding and rebuilding, will talk about how the floods inspired her artistically, and how, despite the sadness of devastation and lives lost, her work
        also depicts the hope and togetherness of a community that has persevered.
    </p>

    <h4>Ice Sculptures</h4>
    <h5>10:30am-1pm: Fountain of Intrigue</h5>

    <p>
        Get on your mittens and earmuffs, and join your fellow artists at the Fountain of Intrigue, in the Hotel Contempo gardens, where the ambient temperature has been turned down to allow the sculpting of ice into the most mysterious and beautiful of shapes.
        Richard Reed will share his secrets for chiseling ice into a shape that your imagination has envisioned. There is an extra fee of $25 for the rental of the tools needed to sculpt ice, if you plan to participate. And we hope you do!
    </p>

    <h4></h4>
    <h5>2:30-4:00pm: Dennison Hall</h5>

    <p>
        Gerard Kent Donahue has been inspiring deep sea divers to paint what they experience under water for nearly two decades. Not only does he explain texture, color, and tools, be he also explains methods for capturing your under sea explorations in your
        mind for future expulsion onto canvas.
